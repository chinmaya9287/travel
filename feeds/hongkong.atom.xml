I love the mass transportation railway,it's so clean, and of course, definitely fast. Everything is well organized here. I rarely seen any traffic jam in here although the street is not as wide as in Indonesia. Public transportation leave and arrive in time. In this case, who needs private vehicle ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training was great too. I have a lot question about tuning that answered here, especially in jvm tuning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Btw, you can see my photo here :

This is my first journey, to Hongkong. We will be here in 4 days, 2 days training, and 2 days for having fun, he he he. Start from subuh at 04.00 AM to the airport. After clearing customs, we proceed to our plane. We ride China Airlines. As you might guess, all languages, writings, newspapers were in chinese. Dunno, maybe my face looks like a chinese guy. Everytime the stewardess served us, they always said Xiexie to me, but to my friend next to me, they said Thankyou :)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, we stay at ChaterHouse hotel. Small and warm place. It's weird in hongkong that all building were Ruko, so the first floor used for Shop/Store, and the next floor will be their homeplace as apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oya, We spent first day with visiting police station. My friend seems to have problem with his passport, so we go to police station and ask for a memo to gave to Immigration office. But finally, in night, somebody from airport called us, he has the passport, thank god :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all, training start...
:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tobe continued..&lt;/p&gt;
